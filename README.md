## It's All About Me

Hello, there fellow nerds, I'm Jason Hunter, an IT consultant from a time when RAM was measured in Kb not Gb. I live in God's own county of the Peoples Republic of Yorkshire, in His Majestyâ€™s United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland. I have spent over 30 years working in IT, mainly Windows-based security and systems management consultancy. I've recently been transitioning to cloud-based technologies on the Azure stack, but this has highlighted the need for me to learn software engineering. So here I am, boot camping my way to software engineering.

## A Particular Set of Skills

The skills I'm looking to hone are Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in order that I can build dynamic frontends and Python backends based on Blazor for Azure-based apps.
